10/24/24, 18:11 - MD Chowdhury joined using your invite
10/24/24, 18:20 - Louis Dodge: Hi guys :-)
10/24/24, 18:32 - James: Hello! Looking forward to working with you both. How should we approach this team contract? I'm thinking of making a live document on Office 365 using the provided template. We can then all add ideas, and once agreed we can sign? Open to ideas.
10/24/24, 18:53 - MD Chowdhury: HI James and Louis
10/24/24, 18:55 - MD Chowdhury: Good Ideaü´°
10/24/24, 18:55 - Louis Dodge: Sounds good to me
10/24/24, 19:38 - MD Chowdhury: Fia joining our Group A
10/24/24, 19:37 - MD Chowdhury added ~‚ÄØStarspace
10/24/24, 19:39 - FIA: Thank you Milad for the invitation.. hi everyone üëãüèª
10/24/24, 19:43 - Louis Dodge: Hiya. We should probably post something on the forum to say the group is full now
10/24/24, 19:47 - James: Happy days. Can everyone send me their student emails please and I'll share access to the team contract.
10/24/24, 19:49 - FIA: <Media omitted>
10/24/24, 19:49 - Louis Dodge: ld24795@essex.ac.uk
10/24/24, 19:49 - FIA: I'll post it
10/24/24, 19:49 - Louis Dodge: Great stuff, thanks
10/24/24, 19:51 - MD Chowdhury: mc24887@essex.ac.uk
10/24/24, 20:04 - James: Thanks everyone. I've given you access and hopefully you've been sent a link. If not I'll see if I can post it in here
10/24/24, 20:06 - James: https://essexuniversity-my.sharepoint.com/:w:/r/personal/je24226_essex_ac_uk/_layouts/15/Doc.aspx?sourcedoc=%7B21407851-456C-4D92-ACFB-EAECAE738BD7%7D&file=Team%20Contract%20Template.docx&action=default&mobileredirect=true&ct=1729793216504&wdOrigin=OFFICECOM-WEB.MAIN.UPLOAD&cid=aa8ef545-a568-4f97-8d9b-cc2dd75a696c&wdPreviousSessionSrc=HarmonyWeb&wdPreviousSession=223bc235-0d20-4434-a048-47b87a34079e
10/24/24, 20:27 - FIA: Thank you üòÅ
10/25/24, 08:57 - FIA: Hi All, I just realised that the Team Contract needs to be completed by the end of Monday 28 October
10/25/24, 09:01 - FIA: <Media omitted>
10/25/24, 09:02 - Louis Dodge: Amazing
10/25/24, 09:02 - Louis Dodge: I can take a look this evening or tomorrow morning, just at the office right now :-)
10/25/24, 09:03 - FIA: yes me too hahah I will take a look when I have time today, unfortunately tomorrow morning until sunday night I have to go to Italy
10/25/24, 09:05 - FIA: If I can finish this, I will share to you all if I can
10/25/24, 09:09 - James: No worries. The contract looks like a straight forward task and there are a few headings to be filled. I filled out goals but happy for it to be expanded on.

The remainder are:

‚Ä¢ *Expectations* - what do we expect from each other? Frequency of communication?

‚Ä¢ *Policies and procedures* 

‚Ä¢ *Roles and responsibilities* - team lead? Rotation of roles? Personally I think brain storming on here is best, but happy to come up with leads etc.

‚Ä¢ *Consequences* - how do we resolve disagreements? What happens if someone fails to meet a deadline?
10/25/24, 09:10 - FIA: I will create the draft then you guys can review and revise as necessary.. I am so sorry, because I cannot attend on Saturday and Sunday if we have group discussion to fill this form as I won't bring my laptop.. I will be back in Malta late at night on Sunday.. The only possible time is Monday if we really need to discuss together
10/25/24, 10:59 - FIA: Hi, I already updated the template thank you üòÄ kindly review and update as necessary
10/25/24, 11:00 - James: I've seen that. Great work, thank you!
10/26/24, 11:09 - MD Chowdhury changed this group's icon
10/26/24, 11:10 - MD Chowdhury: Just seen the contract. Nice work.
10/26/24, 11:11 - MD Chowdhury: Looks fine to meüëçüèΩ
10/26/24, 11:14 - MD Chowdhury: I was listening to Dr Khan's recording, and he seemed quite disappointed, seminar was not attended by anyone. Friday is indeed a very busy day at work. I sent him an email, hoping he will understand.
10/27/24, 11:34 - James: Is there anything else anyone would like to add to the contract? It looks pretty thorough and I'm happy emailing it across if everyone else is.
10/27/24, 11:37 - Louis Dodge: I was pleased with it- seemed pretty thorough.
10/28/24, 13:02 - FIA: Hi.. has anyone emailed the tutor yet?
10/28/24, 13:03 - James: Not yet, was going to do it on my lunch break
10/28/24, 13:03 - FIA: Thank you James üôèüèº
10/28/24, 13:03 - James: I'll CC everyone in and let you know when it is sent
10/28/24, 13:43 - James: That's sent. All CC'd
10/28/24, 13:45 - MD Chowdhury: Thanks James
10/29/24, 11:43 - James: He's seen the contract and is happy with it. When do you want to start working on this team project? I appreciate the deadline is a while away but I like working on these tasks little and often.

For awareness the upcoming month is pretty busy for me. I won't be available at all between the 25th to the 29th.
10/29/24, 17:22 - Louis Dodge: I'm pretty busy the next couple of days, but would have availability on Friday if we want to have an initial catch-up then?
10/29/24, 17:56 - FIA: Friday until 3PM I'm available
10/29/24, 17:56 - FIA: Otherwise perhaps we can find another time on Saturday or Sunday
10/29/24, 17:57 - FIA: I think everyone will have an off day and can spare our time.. however just inform your availability
10/29/24, 17:58 - FIA: In case you're not available
10/30/24, 16:54 - Louis Dodge: What are your thoughts on this, folks? Do we want to have an initial call on Friday, or sometime at the weekend? I have availability for either option, and it sounds like so does Fia.
10/30/24, 16:55 - James: An initial call on Friday sounds good to me
10/30/24, 16:57 - Louis Dodge: Great stuff. Does that work for you, Milad? @447926277520 If so, we can look at working out a time (finishing sometime before 3pm, as per Fia's availability). <This message was edited>
10/30/24, 16:58 - Louis Dodge: Speaking of Friday, I've pinged a message to Dr Khan to check if we have a seminar. He sent out a message saying we did, but the seminar schedule says the next one is on the 8th
10/30/24, 17:15 - MD Chowdhury: Yes , I should be okay
10/30/24, 17:15 - MD Chowdhury: He also asked for ppt slides..little confused
10/30/24, 17:18 - Louis Dodge: As a general rule, I think he wants us to put together a small presentation regarding the questions he sets prior to each seminar, so we can discuss and potentially present.
10/30/24, 17:58 - Louis Dodge: Awesome.
10/30/24, 17:59 - Louis Dodge: I just had a response from Dr Khan about this- we *don't* have a seminar this Friday, it's on the 8th
10/30/24, 18:00 - Louis Dodge: Would 11am work for you guys on Friday?
10/30/24, 18:01 - James: Well noticed. Thanks for the heads up. Anytime is good for me on Friday
10/30/24, 18:24 - FIA: 11 AM UK time right? This is perfect. I'm available
10/30/24, 18:24 - FIA: I have meetings between 09.00-11.00 and 12.00-13.00 ü•≤
10/30/24, 18:25 - Louis Dodge: Amazing, then it sounds like we have a plan! We'll talk 11am UK time on Friday
10/30/24, 18:25 - FIA: Will do, thanks üëçüèª
10/31/24, 18:19 - Louis Dodge: How do we want to catch up tomorrow?
10/31/24, 18:20 - Louis Dodge: Teams may be a good option
10/31/24, 18:22 - James: I can set it up and share the details on here if you want
10/31/24, 18:23 - Louis Dodge: That would be great, thanks James. I just tried, but Teams is being ropey. Not sure if they're having an outage? If I try and create a meeting, I get an error saying 'We are having difficulties connecting to the service right now'
10/31/24, 18:23 - Louis Dodge: I guess failing Teams, we try Google Meets
10/31/24, 18:25 - James: I'll try it in the morning. It's been too long a day to test anything now üòÖ
10/31/24, 18:27 - Louis Dodge: <Media omitted>

11/1/24, 09:50 - Louis Dodge: Teams finally let me create a meeting :-) I'd appreciate if one of you could try joining prior to the meeting, just to confirm it's working.
11/1/24, 10:59 - FIA: guys, I am a bit late, still in meeting thx
11/1/24, 11:13 - Louis Dodge: 1. Looking at working in two subteams. One focusing on intro and part 1 of the assessment (risk assessment of Pampered Pets as it stands currently). One focusing on part 2, risk assessment around potential digitisation.
 
Subteam 1: Fiqki, Louis
Subteam 2: James, Milad

Word count per section:

Intro: 100 words
Part 1: 300 words
Part 2: 400 words
Conclusion: 200 words

Conclusion will be written by group after parts 1 and 2 are done.

Will use a live document in office 365, so we edit at the same time and see each other's work. 

Will get parts 1 and 2 done by the 22nd November. Catch up on the 23rd or 24th to bring two parts together. 

That leaves a week for us to get the conclusion written as a team. James is unavailable 25th to 29th November. <This message was edited>
11/1/24, 11:13 - MD Chowdhury: Some reason I can just listen to you guys..can't message or share
11/1/24, 11:14 - MD Chowdhury: Happy with that plan..but you can't hear me
11/1/24, 11:14 - MD Chowdhury: Silly MS Teams
11/1/24, 11:34 - James: https://essexuniversity-my.sharepoint.com/:w:/r/personal/je24226_essex_ac_uk/_layouts/15/Doc.aspx?sourcedoc=%7B4E7B3360-1D0C-4060-B38B-8EFCB0A7D3FE%7D&file=Document.docx&action=default&mobileredirect=true&DefaultItemOpen=1&ct=1730460701382&wdOrigin=OFFICECOM-WEB.MAIN.REC&cid=3f472179-df9a-488c-9848-854c1b2207ba&wdPreviousSessionSrc=HarmonyWeb&wdPreviousSession=aff880a5-7847-4896-9b5c-dac35aeb08e6
11/1/24, 11:38 - James: To ensure continuity between the two parts we should use the same risk assessment and threat modelling. Any suggestions?
11/1/24, 12:29 - MD Chowdhury: Consider using a framework that is both comprehensive and easy to apply, such as ISO 31000 or NIST 800-30 for risk management, along with a threat modelling tool like STRIDE.
11/6/24, 17:17 - James: <Media omitted>
11/6/24, 17:19 - Louis Dodge: Hi guys, looks like the report is already shaping up well. As some initial feedback, I notice we haven't actually answered the three questions that the report needs to cover. I also saw that the digitisation risk analysis mentions 4 different digital changes, but doesn't really provide strong links between these changes and the risks highlighted via the STRIDE model. It may be better to limit ourselves to covering one or two of these features, so we can actually provide some depth to our analysis.
11/6/24, 17:20 - Louis Dodge: I'll have some time this weekend to contribute, so will hopefully be able to start refining things a bit.
11/6/24, 17:21 - Louis Dodge: Also agreed regarding citations.
11/6/24, 17:22 - James: I've just been fleshing out the digital risk assessment. I'll check over the STRIDE model
11/6/24, 17:26 - Louis Dodge: The references you've got in there regarding American Express/Statista tie in well to the first question, and arguably the third. If we're a bit more explicit about linking that analysis back to the questions, I feel we'll be doing a good job at meeting that criteria.
11/6/24, 17:26 - Louis Dodge: I'll add a bit to the intro outlining the questions we're addressing, to set the stage for your analysis.
11/6/24, 17:29 - James: Nice one. To be honest, the questions are so oddly specific I'm finding it difficult finding credible data to answer them.
11/6/24, 17:31 - Louis Dodge: Right... It feels like a lot to fit into the word count, and the specificity of the questions feels a little arbitrary. That said, as long as we have some reasonable references that support whatever we argue, we should be golden.
11/6/24, 17:59 - James: Sounds good. Had a few more ideas on the report after reading through it again:

1. More critical analysis on the current risk assessment. For example, no access control could lead to tampering; a disgruntled employee may pretend to be the owner and carry out a malicious act, leading to reputational damage; no logging may mean an untrained employee may delete records or orders and can deny doing so.
2. The digital risk analysis then ties into how digitalisation removes these threats and improves the standing of the business. As Louis said, the STRIDE model is linked to the changes.
3. We need to justify the methodology and forms of assessment. Maybe just after the introduction and before the first risk assessment?
11/6/24, 18:00 - Louis Dodge: Agreed on all of this
11/6/24, 20:26 - FIA: I'm sorry, I haven't had the chance to work on this. But will take all of these comments into consideration when I do. Thanks
11/6/24, 22:40 - MD Chowdhury: Okay, valuable points from all, glad to see we are all on the same goal, will refine these points mentioned above further in the report to ensure clarity and depth. And no guarantees if I can join these Friday, but all the best if anyone can make time to speak with Dr Khan.
11/8/24, 14:05 - Louis Dodge: Hi all, I highly recommend watching the recording of today's seminar. Dr Khan went into some detail on what we need to include in the group report, which was very helpful. Definitely answered some questions I had.
11/8/24, 14:09 - Louis Dodge: The gist is that, at least regarding the digitisation risks section, we should take the questions posed as objectives to achieve. We can then identify changes to the way the business operates which would support those objectives, and perform a risk analysis against the changes we propose. E.g opening an online store.
11/8/24, 14:11 - Louis Dodge: He advocated for making heavy use of tables, diagrams and bulletpoints to stay within the word count, and particularly stressed that all the content needs to be heavily focused on the scenario. We don't need to give a definition for what 'risk' actually is, for example, or to dive into details about the risk assessment frameworks we choose.
11/8/24, 14:13 - Louis Dodge: He also noted that records of our communication (he suggested screenshots) need to be included in the appendix, and repeated that in order to receive a grade, it's critical that we complete the peer review regarding how the rest of the team contributed.
11/8/24, 14:49 - James: Sound, that's given me an idea for a rewrite. Each question posed suggests a new change to the business, so I'll adapt that section to answer the questions better.
11/8/24, 14:57 - Louis Dodge: He made clear that given the world length we didn't need to answer the questions one at a time, so might be worth looking at if we can come up with a change or two that would support all 3 objectives (growing the business, reducing supply chain costs, prevent loss of customers)
11/8/24, 15:00 - James: Outsourcing to a cloud based e-commerce platform will solve most of it, with perhaps online marketing to expand reach?
11/9/24, 13:24 - Louis Dodge: That's an interesting approach, especially given that with cloud services responsibility is split between the consumer and the cloud provider. Could be a good way to ensure they have a reasonable level of security, even without having expertise in-house. <This message was edited>
11/9/24, 13:25 - Louis Dodge: I think that's actually a really appropriate response.
11/9/24, 13:30 - James: Good point on the split between responsibilities, I'm sure I can work that in there. I've rewritten it to reflect just implementing an e-commerce platform to achieve the three objectives. I've also found an extract on how e-commerce can reduce supply chain costs.
11/9/24, 13:34 - Louis Dodge: I'll be taking a look in a few mins, too :-)
11/9/24, 14:22 - MD Chowdhury: Afternoon all, just read through   the report, getting Just better, I think adding a quantitative risk analysis would strengthen our report. Alongside our qualitative descriptions, we could estimate potential costs for incidents like data breaches or downtime. This would give us clearer data to compare the financial impact of staying as we are versus digitalising.
If you‚Äôre on board, I can add a brief note in the ‚ÄúRisk Assessment Approach‚Äù section to include this.
Let me know what you think! And of course within  word limit.
11/9/24, 14:30 - James: Sounds good. A quantitative approach will certainly strengthen the argument
11/9/24, 20:24 - FIA: Hi All, will check it over this weekend
11/11/24, 08:46 - Louis Dodge: Morning, all. The report is coming together well. It's at the right length, and flows logically. There's some redundancy under the 'current risk assessment' section, which I'll look at addressing when I get a sec. We also need to create a timeline to implement the advised changes. I'll look at making a Gantt chart for that this week.
11/11/24, 09:07 - FIA: Hi Louis, I can make a draft for this section as well.. I haven't contributed in the report
11/11/24, 09:33 - Louis Dodge: Great stuff, thanks Fia
11/11/24, 10:23 - MD Chowdhury: Added now
11/12/24, 18:16 - James: Anyone want to do another teams call on Friday and go through the report together?
11/13/24, 01:58 - MD Chowdhury: Hi James, sorry for the late reply, I can't make it on Friday, but I can start the full review from Thursday. If you're available, I can join the call via Teams, otherwise I'll leave notes for you. I assume we're ready for formatting and final touch!
11/13/24, 18:16 - James: No worries. I should be free Friday, which is why I thought I'd suggest that. Yeah looks like it's a bit of refining now. Still 2 weeks or so away from the deadline so there's nothing to worry about
11/13/24, 20:06 - MD Chowdhury: Would it be okay if I added a cover page, table of contents and page numbers? Those don't count in words, just giving the report a pro look.
11/14/24, 15:43 - Louis Dodge: Absolutely, that would be a helpful improvement.
11/16/24, 02:17 - FIA: Hi.. I already reworded the current risk assessment to make it not redundant, especially the Tampering and Insider Threats part where Tampering focuses on vulnerabilities in the system itself, Insider Threats emphasize risks tied to the behavior and intent of individuals with authorized access. Also, for the DoS part, I removed the second point where it was mention about employee availability, because it has been mentioned in Operational Disruption section already. Kindly review. <This message was edited>
11/16/24, 02:18 - FIA: Also I made the Gantt chart already based on the Recommendation section
11/16/24, 02:19 - FIA: I inserted it under the Summary of Recommendations, however the image is a bit blurry, please check and kindly advise how I can insert better image quality <This message was edited>
11/16/24, 02:20 - FIA: <Media omitted>
11/16/24, 02:21 - FIA: Thanks :)
11/16/24, 02:23 - FIA: https://essexuniversity-my.sharepoint.com/:w:/r/personal/je24226_essex_ac_uk/_layouts/15/doc2.aspx?sourcedoc=%7B4E7B3360-1D0C-4060-B38B-8EFCB0A7D3FE%7D&file=Document.docx&action=default&mobileredirect=true&DefaultItemOpen=1&ct=1730460701382&wdOrigin=OFFICECOM-WEB.MAIN.REC&cid=3f472179-df9a-488c-9848-854c1b2207ba&wdPreviousSessionSrc=HarmonyWeb&wdPreviousSession=aff880a5-7847-4896-9b5c-dac35aeb08e6
11/16/24, 02:24 - FIA: copying the link again for easier visibility
11/16/24, 17:00 - Louis Dodge: Awesome, great stuff. I'm going to take a look again in a few minutes. I may strip out the quantitative approach mentioned in the intro, as we don't really have the data necessary to actually quantify the likelihood or impact of risks materialising.
11/16/24, 17:01 - Louis Dodge: I'd be all for it if we did have sufficient info, but as it stands I think we'll have to rely on a high-level qualitative approach.
11/16/24, 19:16 - FIA: I agree Louis, I was thinking the same thing but I forgot to mention it.. let me know if there's anything I should do
11/16/24, 19:18 - Louis Dodge: Amazing, thanks Fia. I'll let you know if anything comes up :-) Thanks for getting the Gantt chart done, I'll give that look over when I get a sec, and see if I can find why it was so low res.
11/16/24, 19:18 - FIA: Yes please check and feel free to revise it
11/16/24, 19:19 - FIA: I used excel to create it
11/16/24, 19:19 - FIA: If you revise it please upload again the latest chart for our visibility. thank you
11/17/24, 11:43 - MD Chowdhury: https://1drv.ms/w/c/51702f81ebfcad20/EXVSh2kD1MhCn5uHc8-5yD8BTZRuFVemSfjj5xO-ETzG0w?e=iDs3sc
11/17/24, 11:47 - MD Chowdhury: I added a page number and table of contents to make it easier to read, but I didn't remove or edit anything. If you find anything duplicated or doesn't make sense, feel free to remove it. @447806705250  couldn't add it to your shared OneDrive folder maybe permission issue, but you can add the doc in your shared folder. Thanks
11/17/24, 17:53 - James: I've added your changes into the original document. Having multiple copies of this will make it easy to lose track of changes.

Few thoughts and keen to hear other ideas:
1. Are we agreed on stripping out the qualitative approach piece? It will save on the word count. To provide balance it may be pertinent to mention it, and say why we didn't take a qualitative approach.
2. The summary of recommendations needs amending to reflect going for a cloud service broker which offers these services, as opposed to implementing them individually.
3. There is a lot of information on the Gantt chart, making it difficult to read. Simplifying it to something along the lines of *research service providers* > *trial with small customer base* > *feedback* > *full implementation* may make it more meaningful
4. With the qualitative approach taken out, this leaves space for a conclusion to tie it together, as opposed to the summary of recommendations as the conclusion.
11/17/24, 18:02 - Louis Dodge: Awesome, thanks James. Haven't had a chance to strip out the qualitative stuff yet as something came up at home. Will get this done tomorrow or Tuesday. I'm thinking it might be worth seeing if we could submit a draft of our report by the end of the week to Dr Khan, to get feedback on the current state. That way we'd have a week to revise based on his feedback.
11/19/24, 19:26 - James: Good idea, didn't know that was an option.
11/19/24, 19:26 - Louis Dodge: I don't know if it is, haha
11/19/24, 19:26 - Louis Dodge: I'll ping him a message tomorrow and ask üòÅ
11/19/24, 19:27 - Louis Dodge: This should also read quantitative rather than qualitative, typo on my part.
11/19/24, 19:40 - James: Ah made the same mistake üòÇ I'm away Monday - Friday next week so would be good to make some significant contributions this week
11/19/24, 21:59 - FIA: I'll update the gantt chart accordingly by this week
11/21/24, 11:19 - FIA: <Media omitted>
11/21/24, 11:19 - FIA: https://onedrive.live.com/personal/51702f81ebfcad20/_layouts/15/Doc.aspx?sourcedoc=%7B69875275-d403-42c8-9f9b-8773cfb9c83f%7D&action=default&redeem=aHR0cHM6Ly8xZHJ2Lm1zL3cvYy81MTcwMmY4MWViZmNhZDIwL0VYVlNoMmtEMU1oQ241dUhjOC01eUQ4QlRaUnVGVmVtU2ZqajV4Ty1FVHpHMHc_ZT1pRHMzc2M&slrid=be0966a1-b01d-a000-95d9-a792d6a97c7b&originalPath=aHR0cHM6Ly8xZHJ2Lm1zL3cvYy81MTcwMmY4MWViZmNhZDIwL0VYVlNoMmtEMU1oQ241dUhjOC01eUQ4QlRaUnVGVmVtU2ZqajV4Ty1FVHpHMHc_cnRpbWU9RVI1RHlSMEszVWc&CID=b4cc277e-a7bd-4e41-bf13-0cdc7c8b730f&_SRM=0:G:48
11/23/24, 11:33 - James: Thanks Fia. Personally I prefer this smaller Gantt chart due to its readability. We need to avoid making changes in separate documents though. Here is the original: 

https://tinyurl.com/group-a-report

With the quantitative piece taken out, that gave us some room to play with for the word count. I added a conclusion to tie it all together; however if anyone feels it's redundant feel free to remove so we can add depth to other sections.

I've also tidied up the reference list. If anyone wants to double check that they are correct, it will be appreciated
11/23/24, 13:41 - FIA: Hi James, you could perhaps create the Gantt Chart according to your preference so other members can see and decide as well whether they'd rather use your preference
11/23/24, 13:43 - FIA: I only change the Gantt chart using the original document that Milad last time copied
11/23/24, 13:43 - FIA: I assumed this is also the same one as what I used the last time
11/23/24, 13:44 - James: I like your new one! That's what I meant. I've copied it into the original report
11/23/24, 13:44 - FIA: The last time I used this version
11/23/24, 13:52 - FIA: I already copied the Gantt chart to this report as well
11/23/24, 13:53 - FIA: @447926277520 can you confirm whether you used the latest report from the link that I copied last time? Because I revised the current risk assessment to make it not redundant according to Louis's comment <This message was edited>
11/23/24, 13:54 - FIA: also is this document the latest one from Milad's link?
11/23/24, 13:57 - James: This is what I mean by multiple copies causing confusion. We should be using the original document on my shared drive as per our original agreement.

When I checked, the Gantt chart had been updated on Milad's version, not the original. This is why I copied it over.

The quantitative segments had been taken out the original document, and this is the one I have been revising.

The tinyurl I just linked is the one in my shared drive, not the latest one in Milad's link.
11/23/24, 13:57 - FIA: the link may seems longer than Milad's link, but I used Milad's doc
11/23/24, 14:00 - FIA: did you copy the content in Milad's link to the one in the tinyurl? Because if Milad is using different document, now the one in Milad's link and your latest link are exactly the same with cover and page number <This message was edited>
11/23/24, 14:01 - FIA: and I need to revise again the content in current risk assessment if @447926277520 used the old version before I revised on this date
11/23/24, 14:06 - James: They both have a cover page and page numbers, however have different content.  The current risk assessment on both documents match. The tinyurl I linked to (the original document) has the latest revisions
11/23/24, 14:06 - Louis Dodge: James is right, we need to be sticking to one shared document.
11/23/24, 14:07 - FIA: I thought since the beginning there is no different version, just the link address is difference <This message was edited>
11/23/24, 14:08 - FIA: it can happen, for example between my link and the original link, or my link and Milad's link
11/23/24, 14:09 - James: They are two different documents on different drives. This is the document we should be working on: 

https://tinyurl.com/group-a-report
11/23/24, 14:10 - FIA: now I am using the tinyurl and compare the current risk with the one that I downloaded on this date
11/23/24, 14:10 - ~‚ÄØStarspace pinned a message
11/23/24, 14:10 - FIA: I pin this, so it does not get lost <This message was edited>
11/23/24, 14:11 - James: The tinyurl is the original document. I've just shortened the link
11/23/24, 14:16 - FIA: ok, the current risk that I revised according to Louis comment has been reflected in this report
11/25/24, 23:30 - MD Chowdhury: Hi everyone, sorry for the late reply, hope you‚Äôre all doing well. Just to confirm, James‚Äô TinyURL is up to date, so all good there.

I‚Äôve gone through tutor instructions carefully, and this will likely be my final review. Key points:

1. Fonts and word size ‚Äì ensuring everything matches.


2. Avoid explaining definitions; focus on how the processes or impacts relate to the business.


3. Add critical analysis where possible.


4. I‚Äôm not adding anything new, just making slight improvements to strengthen the academic perspective where needed. I‚Äôve added a tracker to the document so you can see any changes and revert them if you disagree or have better ideas.
5. I've also filled out the peer review forms for my submission. No need to mention‚Äîyou are all superstars‚≠ê
11/27/24, 16:22 - Louis Dodge: Awesome, great stuff! I'll fill out my peer review this evening.
11/27/24, 16:22 - Louis Dodge: It's worth noting, if we're generous toward each other, we can *all* do better üòÅ
11/27/24, 16:26 - Louis Dodge: Thanks for genuinely being a good team, guys
11/28/24, 07:23 - FIA: hi all, do you want to have one last discussion to review the report or do you think we can submit the latest report?
11/28/24, 09:46 - MD Chowdhury: Morning Fia, have you had a chance to review the latest version?
11/28/24, 11:03 - FIA: Yes.. I have no comment milad
11/28/24, 11:03 - FIA: I didn't revise any
11/28/24, 12:34 - MD Chowdhury: James is not available until the 29th, once he's back, we can decide on submission one of the weekend.
11/29/24, 17:21 - James: I'm back now, so can do some point over the weekend
12/1/24, 15:08 - James: I'm really happy with the report. I think we've made a great effort on it. I was dreading being in a poor team, so thank you everybody for smashing it!

Just filling out the peer review form. Have you guys done referencing or kept it pretty basic?
12/1/24, 15:51 - Louis Dodge: Looks good to me, too. I'm going to have a last glance over it this evening, mainly just regarding grammar and spelling. Will also revisit the last seminar, as I believe Dr Khan said we need information regarding our group communication in the appendix (screenshots of chats etc.), so just want to double check what format he wants that in.
12/1/24, 17:40 - FIA: I have no comment on our report
12/1/24, 17:40 - FIA: I think it's good to submit
12/1/24, 17:40 - FIA: Who will submit it?
12/1/24, 18:52 - MD Chowdhury: I kept it simple, just explained in writing how all added value to their experiences. all 5 star rated and 35/35 ü•≥
12/1/24, 18:52 - MD Chowdhury: I think after last  review, Louis may be
12/2/24, 08:35 - MD Chowdhury: <Media omitted>
12/2/24, 09:02 - James: That's insane. Can't do that and stay within the editorial guidelines
12/2/24, 09:10 - MD Chowdhury: Honestly I didn't notice this before, I only saw 1000 words limit
12/2/24, 09:16 - MD Chowdhury: I have just checked my notes, it wasn't there when we started
12/2/24, 10:04 - Louis Dodge: Urgh, I'd missed this...
12/2/24, 10:05 - Louis Dodge: We're within the 1000 word limit, but yeah we blow past 2 pages
12/2/24, 10:05 - Louis Dodge: Doesn't really work to ask for tables and diagrams in the main body, but also only 2 pages, tbh.
12/2/24, 10:24 - MD Chowdhury: I am emailing  tutor, 2 page limit message wasn't there, this is kind of cheeky way to telling us in last day of submission
12/2/24, 10:37 - MD Chowdhury: I have ccd you all
12/2/24, 10:39 - Louis Dodge: You sure it wasn't? I suspect it was and we missed it
12/2/24, 10:50 - MD Chowdhury: I copied the instruction from the web to my note, from start, so I can follow along and don't have to log in every time online. Also, we all can't miss the same information, and I've seen you and  all working with small details, Louis, you wouldn't miss it, I have seen how careful you were.
12/2/24, 10:55 - Louis Dodge: Haha, your faith is appreciated. I haven't submitted yet, so we've got a few hours to try and clear things up with Dr Khan.
12/2/24, 11:10 - MD Chowdhury: Yeah, we can wait for few more hours
12/2/24, 13:21 - FIA: Is it okay if we make the font smaller?
12/2/24, 13:23 - James: I had a look at doing single spacing and smaller font but it looks terrible
12/2/24, 17:00 - Louis Dodge: FYI for the peer feedback, if giving especially high  or low grades (1 or 5), we have to provide justification <This message was edited>
12/2/24, 17:01 - Louis Dodge: I provided justification as part of my answers to the questions below the scores. 

'The team was fantastic to work with. From the beginning, everyone was engaged, responsive and quick to participate. All members contributed significantly to the structure and content of our report, as well as attending meetings. All participants provided valuable feedback and constructive criticism, which was quickly incorporated into our report. The extremely high ratings for my fellow teammates reflects their impactful and largely equitable contributions to the success of the project as a whole.' <This message was edited>
12/2/24, 18:35 - FIA: did you receive a reply from him?
12/2/24, 18:52 - MD Chowdhury: Nah, we are all cc'd
12/2/24, 19:12 - James: I'm tempted to leave it as is. We are within the word count, and putting it on 2 pages with tables and diagrams seems unrealistic
12/2/24, 19:43 - MD Chowdhury: We can remove the cover page, table of contents, and let's submit.
12/2/24, 20:09 - FIA: Who will submit the report?
12/2/24, 20:09 - Louis Dodge: I'm happy to
12/2/24, 20:10 - FIA: Thank you Louis
12/2/24, 23:53 - Louis Dodge: Submitted :-) I made a few changes to try and improve it, and to reduce page count. I had some success, though still not close to 2 pages!
12/2/24, 23:54 - Louis Dodge: <Media omitted>
12/2/24, 23:54 - Louis Dodge: Here's the submitted version. Excuse it not being on the shared doc, I was scrambling to get it formatted in Word
12/2/24, 23:56 - Louis Dodge: The main change I made was updating the tables to include the mitigations, so they were more clearly mapped to the risks they were designed to counter.
12/3/24, 02:49 - MD Chowdhury: Thank you üëè
12/3/24, 13:40 - MD Chowdhury: <Media omitted>
12/10/24, 00:42 - Louis Dodge: We've got our grades back, guys :-) Well done all.
12/10/24, 00:48 - MD Chowdhury: Great team work üëè
12/10/24, 09:17 - FIA: Thank you all
