                        <p>
                          I've been working in IT for around eight years. I started off on a service desk and then worked my way up to leading technical projects and designing network architecture.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                          I really started getting into my trade during the COVID 19 Pandemic. I was fortunate enough that my work were funding certifications. During this time I passed the CCNA, CCNP enterprise, CompTIA Security+ and a handful of other tests. I'm looking forward to challenging myself with this course.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                          In my spare time, I'm into running and keeping fit. I also enjoy studying, reading and practicing chess.

    <h1>Reflection on Performance in the Security and Risk Management Module</h1>
    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>Understanding security and risk management is essential for me as a future cybersecurity professional to navigate the increasing digital risks enterprises face. However, this module presented several challenges, including maintaining focus and balancing workload. This reflection uses Kolb’s Learning Cycle, a training strategy designed to “involve the participants in skill practice” (ISC Medical, 2019), to analyse my experiences during the module and develop a Personal Development Plan to enhance my performance for future learning.</p>
    <h2>Concrete Experience</h2>
    <p>The first step of Kolb’s learning cycle involves the Concrete Experience. The first assessment was a group project involving creating a Risk Identification Report. This allowed us to understand the difference between qualitative and quantitative risk models and their practical application. I was responsible for enumerating the enterprise's future risks, an essential real-world skill, and developing the structure and layout. I played a significant role in the project's development and was a frequent and vocal contributor to the group.</p>
    <p>The first few weeks also involved a collaborative “Industry 4.0” discussion, which provided background knowledge on what risks an enterprise may face with digitalisation. The module culminated in an “Executive Summary,” showcasing our individual quantitative risk assessment abilities and our understanding of disaster recovery solutions. I struggled with this assignment and will reflect on why in the subsequent section.</p>
    <h2>Key Takeaways</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>I developed teamwork skills through the group project and peer review.</li>
        <li>My understanding of quantitative and qualitative risk assessments significantly improved.</li>
        <li>I learnt practical disaster recovery solutions to carry into my professional work.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Reflective Observation</h2>
    <p>The next stage of Kolb’s Learning Cycle involves analysing the experiences from the previous stage. This lays the basis for understanding what worked well and what can be improved.</p>
    <p>Looking back over the module, I enjoyed the group project the most. The dynamic allowed me to refine my communication skills. It gave me the freedom to present my ideas, a skill I have not been able to practice in my hierarchical professional setting. We consistently provided ideas and improved on others' suggestions as a group. I was proud of our product and learned much from my peers during the engagements. There were on occasions issues within the team, however this was quickly rectified through clear communication channels.</p>
    <p>I struggled to engage with all the content, so I did not apply myself to my fullest potential. I preferred previous modules, such as Network Security, where I could spend plenty of time honing more practical skills. When reading through the standards and frameworks, I frequently got distracted and failed to finish the material. I also failed to engage fully with the seminar content. I felt this restricted the depth of my knowledge, which increased the work I had to complete to get the individual Executive Summary to an acceptable level.</p>
    <h2>Lessons Learned</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Collaborative work is essential to improving teamwork dynamics and individual abilities.</li>
        <li>Time management is crucial for improving work and understanding.</li>
        <li>The formative tasks are there to aid our learning. I must engage with them fully.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Abstract Conceptualisation</h2>
    <p>From the reflection, I can develop theories around my learning. For example, I found the group work highly beneficial. The structure of my individual Executive Summary evidenced this. Elements of the assignment, such as the structure and layout, were taken from the group discussion, which I would not have considered implementing. A strong, proactive group can positively develop everyone involved. This aligns with Tuckman’s group development model and the “performing” stage (WCU, 2024).</p>
    <p>I also reflected that I struggled to balance my work and study routine. Because of this, I failed to engage fully with the seminars and their content. This resulted in my work lacking elements, making it challenging to provide the necessary depth. Time management is crucial for engaging correctly with content and enhancing understanding.</p>
    <h2>Conceptual Frameworks</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>A cohesive and proactive group can positively develop all participants.</li>
        <li>Allocating dedicated time blocks for studying is crucial for engaging correctly with content and enhancing understanding.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Active Experimentation</h2>
    <p>The final stage of Kolb’s Learning Cycle is applying these concepts to the real world. In other words, I will take what I have reflected on and develop a personal development plan for further modules.</p>
    <p>In further modules, I must maintain a positive outlook in my teamwork. This will involve clear communication, positive reinforcement for other group members, and an openness to new ideas. This correlates with my theory that a cohesive group can positively develop all members.</p>
    <p>In future modules, I must consider how to balance work and studying. This could mean I delegate some work responsibilities to subordinates or maintain the discipline to guarantee at least two hours of study time daily. I should also seek ideas from the Student Support Team, as I will not be the only student with this issue. Another method to maintain focus is the Pomodoro Technique, which will help increase engagement by focusing on short bursts of work followed by small breaks (Sheldon, N.D.), or adopting the Eisenhower Matrix, where I address tasks based on their urgency and importance (Asana, 2024).</p>
    <h2>Development Plan</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Maintain a positive approach to group work. Actionable steps include assisting in assigning roles and responsibilities and taking on roles that may be out of my comfort zone.</li>
        <li>Focus on time management by delegating responsibilities or engaging with the Student Support Team for ideas. I can also adopt the Eisenhower Matrix, distinguishing or the Pomodoro technique.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>I found the Security and Risk Management module difficult to engage with. From this reflection, I realised that whilst I found teamwork beneficial, my poor time management meant I did not engage enough with the material. In further modules, I must ensure I manage time effectively and remember the lessons learnt from my peers, guaranteeing I maintain the strong performance I have achieved in the previous modules.</p>

    <h1>Summary of Collaborative Discussions on Industry 4.0 and the Failings of CVSS</h1>
    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>The first collaborative discussion was based on the case study provided by Kovaitė and Stankevičienė (2019). During the discussion, we were to describe what the authors meant by ‘Industry 4.0’, give two real-world examples of risks that fit into the authors' categories, and find another journal article supporting or contradicting the points made in the cited study. The second collaborative discussion detailed criticisms of CVSS and the alternatives. Due to the limited number of posts, this post summarises both discussions.</p>
    <h2>Industry 4.0 Case Study</h2>
    <p>Kovaitė and Stankevičienė describe Industry 4.0 as a ‘Fourth Industrial Revolution’ encompassing areas such as IoT (Internet of Things), cloud computing and AI (Artificial Intelligence. This corresponds with the definition given by McKinsey & Company (2022), who argue it is a strategic priority for any business in a rapidly digitalising economy.</p>
    <p>The case study then produced a ‘RADi’ matrix (Risk Assessment for Digitalisation), which detailed six risk categories concerning Industry 4.0. One highlighted risk is data security, which is exemplified by an estimated $20 billion loss worldwide due to cyber-attacks on the banking sector (Wang, 2024).</p>
    <p>The age of the case study is a significant limitation. Written six years ago, it does not account for the changing digital landscape brought on by the COVID-19 pandemic (Contreras, 2019) and the increase in technologies such as AI. Risks such as ‘acceptance by clients’ and’ acceptance by staff’ may be negligible, and more significant risks should include technological implementation or legislation violations (Dokuchaev, 2020).</p>
    <h2>CVSS Case Study</h2>
    <p>The second collaborative discussion involved the work by Spring et al. (2021). This work argued that the CVSS has multiple shortcomings and is too generic. It fails to account for context (such as a vulnerability being more critical to one organisation than another) and material consequences (such as life or property being threatened). Despite these shortcomings, it is still being pushed by NIST and recommended by PCI DSS.</p>
    <p>After reading the article and my peers' discussions, I agree with the assessment from Springer et al. The lack of context and overall generic nature of CVSS generate inefficient risk communication. As Cains (2022) states, humans cannot interpret terms if they are “not defined in a clear and conceptual manner.”</p>
    <p>As an alternative to CVSS, Spring et al. suggest using ‘Stakeholder-Specific Vulnerability Categorization’. This qualitative framework uses decision trees to provide explainable outputs (Hughes, 2024). Unlike CVSS, which fails to account for context, SSVC considers the multiple stakeholders.</p>
    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>The two collaborative discussions covered a wide variety of topics. Kovaitė and Stankevičienė's case study broadly analyses the digitalisation risks with Industry 4.0. However, there should be a renewed focus on emerging risks such as AI and legislative issues, especially after the remote-working change brought on by the pandemic. Spring et al.'s work covers the shortfalls of CVSS and offers an alternative system. The SSVC offers a qualitative framework that effectively accounts for stakeholder interests. Both pieces of work have been highly beneficial in the context of Security and Risk Management.</p>
