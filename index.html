                        <p>
                          I've been working in IT for around eight years. I started off on a service desk and then worked my way up to leading technical projects and designing network architecture.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                          I really started getting into my trade during the COVID 19 Pandemic. I was fortunate enough that my work were funding certifications. During this time I passed the CCNA, CCNP enterprise, CompTIA Security+ and a handful of other tests. I'm looking forward to challenging myself with this course.

                          In my spare time, I'm into running and keeping fit. I also enjoy studying, reading and practicing chess.

    <h1>Reflection on Performance in the Security and Risk Management Module</h1>
    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>Understanding security and risk management is essential for me as a future cybersecurity professional to navigate the increasing digital risks enterprises face. However, this module presented several challenges, including maintaining focus and balancing workload. This reflection uses Kolbâs Learning Cycle, a training strategy designed to âinvolve the participants in skill practiceâ (ISC Medical, 2019), to analyse my experiences during the module and develop a Personal Development Plan to enhance my performance in future modules.</p>
    <h2>Concrete Experience</h2>
    <p>The first part of Kolbâs learning cycle involves the Concrete Experience. The first assessment was a group project involving creating a Risk Identification Report. This allowed us to understand the difference between qualitative and quantitative risk models and their practical application. It also allowed us to understand their real-world application. I was responsible for enumerating the enterprise's future risks, an essential real-world skill, and developing the structure and layout. I played a significant role in the project's development and was a frequent and vocal contributor to the group.</p>
    <p>The first few weeks also involved a collaborative âIndustry 4.0â discussion, which provided background knowledge on what risks an enterprise may face with digitalisation. The module culminated in an âExecutive Summary,â showcasing our individual quantitative risk assessment abilities and our understanding of disaster recovery solutions. I struggled with this assignment and will reflect on why in the subsequent section.</p>
    <h2>Key Takeaways</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>I developed teamwork skills through the group project and peer review.</li>
        <li>My understanding of quantitative and qualitative risk assessments significantly improved.</li>
        <li>I learnt practical disaster recovery solutions to carry into my professional work.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Reflective Observation</h2>
    <p>The next stage of Kolbâs Learning Cycle involves analysing the experiences from the previous stage. This lays the basis for understanding what worked well and what can be improved.</p>
    <p>Looking back over the module, I enjoyed the group project the most. The dynamic allowed me to refine my communication skills. It gave me the freedom to present my ideas, a skill I have not been able to practice in my hierarchical professional setting. We consistently provided ideas and improved on others' suggestions as a group. I was proud of our product and learned much from my peers during the engagements.</p>
    <p>I struggled to engage with all the content, so I did not apply myself to my fullest potential. I preferred previous modules, such as Network Security, where I could spend plenty of time honing more practical skills. When reading through the standards and frameworks, I frequently got distracted and failed to finish the material. I also failed to engage fully with the seminar content. I felt this restricted the depth of my knowledge, which is evidenced in the individual Executive Summary.</p>
    <p>Furthermore, I allowed my professional life to get in the way of my learning. After a recent promotion, my workload increased, and I did not want to spend more time on a laptop revising. I worked around this by printing out some of the material and ordering paper copies of textbooks, where I found it easier to assimilate information.</p>
    <h2>Lessons Learned</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Collaborative work is essential to improving teamwork dynamics and individual abilities.</li>
        <li>Time management is crucial for improving work and understanding.</li>
        <li>If I struggle with an area of the module, such as absorbing the information in the reading lists, I need to âthink outside the boxâ to work around the struggle.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Abstract Conceptualisation</h2>
    <p>From the reflection, I can develop theories around my learning. For example, I found the group work highly beneficial. The structure of my individual Executive Summary evidenced this. Elements of the Summary, such as the structure and layout, were taken from the group discussion, which I would not have considered implementing. A strong, proactive group can positively develop everyone involved. This aligns with Tuckmanâs group development model and the âperformingâ stage (WCU, 2024).</p>
    <p>I also reflected that I struggled to balance my work and study routine. This resulted in my work lacking elements, making it challenging to provide the necessary depth. Because of this, I failed to engage fully with the seminars and their content. Time management is crucial for engaging correctly with content and enhancing understanding.</p>
    <h2>Conceptual Frameworks</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>A cohesive and proactive group can positively develop all participants.</li>
        <li>Allocating dedicated time blocks for studying is crucial for engaging correctly with content and enhancing understanding.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Active Experimentation</h2>
    <p>The final stage of Kolbâs Learning Cycle is applying these concepts to the real world. In other words, I will take what I have reflected on and develop a personal development plan for further modules.</p>
    <p>In further modules, I must maintain a positive outlook in my teamwork. This will involve clear communication, positive reinforcement for other group members, and an openness to new ideas. This coincides with my theory a cohesive group can positively develop all members.</p>
    <p>In future modules, I must consider how to balance work and studying. This could mean I delegate some work responsibilities to subordinates or maintain the discipline to guarantee at least two hours of study time daily. I should also seek ideas from the Student Support Team, as I will not be the only student with this issue. Another method to maintain focus is the Pomodoro Technique, which will help increase engagement by focusing on short bursts of work followed by small breaks (Sheldon, N.D.).</p>
    <h2>Development Plan</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Maintain a positive approach to group work. Actionable steps include assisting in assigning roles and responsibilities and taking on roles that may be out of my comfort zone.</li>
        <li>Focus on time management by delegating responsibilities or engaging with the Student Support Team for ideas. I can also adopt the Eisenhower Matrix, distinguishing tasks based on their urgency and importance and prioritising them (Asana, 2024), or the Pomodoro technique.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>I found the Security and Risk Management module difficult to engage with. From this reflection, I realised that whilst I found teamwork beneficial, my poor time management meant I did not engage enough with the material. In further modules, I must ensure I manage time effectively and remember the lessons learnt from my peers, guaranteeing I maintain the strong performance I have achieved in the previous modules.</p>

                            <p>Cathy has decided to start the digitalisation process. In addition to the changes you recommended, she has decided to add an international supply chain and a number of automated warehouses worldwide. The changes immediately attract the attention of two very high-profile new customers â HRH the King and Prince Albert 2nd of Monaco. However, both are concerned about the effect of these digitalisation changes on the world-famous quality of the products and the security of the supply chain.</p>

                            <p>Produce an Executive Summary which provides an estimate of the probabilities that changes to the operations of the business and the supply chain could endanger both the quality and availability of the company's products. Note that the associated grading criteria are highlighted in the requirements below, to be reviewed alongside the criteria grid located in Module Resources.</p>

                            <strong>Learning Outcomes:</strong>
                            <li>Critically determine appropriate methodologies, tools and techniques to mitigate and/or solve security risks and their business impact.</li>
                            <li>Articulate the legal, social, ethical, and professional issues faced by information security and risk professionals.</li>
